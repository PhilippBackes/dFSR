# A practical approach on non-regular sampling and universal demosaicing of raw image sensor data

# London Imaging Meeting 2020: Future Colour Imaging, pp. 91-95(5)


# Best start with dFSRExampleSingle to process a single image from the ARRI Imageset

# To process the whole ImageSet use dFSRExampleImageSet. Yet you have to build the Image set first with BuildImageSet.

# Sensor Simulation Example gives you an insight on how the simulation works
